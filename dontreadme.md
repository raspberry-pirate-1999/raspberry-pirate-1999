- 👋 Hi, I’m @raspberry-pirate-1999, also known as an overzealous Raspberry Pi enthusiast who wants to see modular Pis, Raspberry Pi laptops, and the like because I foolishly believe that Raspberry Pis can do anything
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a professional full-stack developer and possible game developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, C, C#, C++, Python, JavaScript, and all sorts of fun, pseudo-technician skills because I want to have a good reason to never go outside again
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a possible PicoBoot for the Wii? Maybe? Please? I'll give you a crisp American dollar?
- 📫 How to reach me (859-475-9536) (don't f**king call me you c**ts) only talk to me if you're serious about teaching me how to do actual cool stuff with Raspberry Pis (I'm a Democrat, so I don't give a piss about your political opinion if you believe Donald Trump should be POTUS) 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/they
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Pi!!!

<!---
raspberry-pirate-1999 is a ✨ special ✨ little f**ker because she is autistic enough to think that modifying a .md file counts as coding because it appears on their GitHub profile.
You can go f**k yourself in the a** (it feels better than you think it does, trust me ;3)
